#### Github Pull Request Project

Pulls the pull requests for a repo and displays the:
- user
- number of commits
- number of comments

##### How to run the program
- run ``yarn install`` to install the dependencies
- run ```yarn dev``` to run the program
- Go to localhost:3000 in the browser
- Type in a Github url and click Huzzah!

##### How to run the test
- run ```yarn test``` 

##### Assumptions
- I used the Next.js framework create react ui and integrations in the framework to make backend calls using axios
- The input is taken in by serving the ui and putting in the github url rather than console

##### Future enhancements
- More tests! Given this being a real project, I would have written tests
- Dockerize!
- yml file for deployment
